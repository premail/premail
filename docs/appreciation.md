üöÄ Built with original inspiration from
[dalefish/mjml-boilerplate-win](https://github.com/dalefish/mjml-boilerplate-win).

üôè Thanks, of course, to the folks working on
[mjmlio/mjml](https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml). You are the light in the terrible
email-HTML darkness.

## Using the following fine tools

- [Yargs](https://yargs.js.org/) and
  [terkelg/prompts](https://github.com/terkelg/prompts) for making command-line
  Node programs an easy process.

- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), especially Gulp v4, for efficient build
  processes.

- [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) for easy-to-grok templating.

- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for stylesheets that still have superpowers
  (yes, beyond CSS custom properties!)

- Codsen's [detergent](https://codsen.com/os/detergent/) for sanitizing content
  for emails, and related projects for
  [processing partial HTML](https://codsen.com/os/html-crush/) and
  [enforcing image alt tags](https://codsen.com/os/html-img-alt/).

- [davidmerfield/Typeset](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Typeset) for
  automating great typography.

- [html-to-text/node-html-to-text](https://github.com/html-to-text/node-html-to-text)
  for rendering beautiful plaintext versions of emails.

- [nodeca/js-yaml](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml) because storing config in
  YAML files rather than JSON is so much better!

- [validator.js](https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js) for
  double-checking those config values.

- [pmowrer/node-sass-json-importer](https://github.com/pmowrer/node-sass-json-importer)
  for importing configuration into CSS.

- [dec0dOS/amazing-github-template](https://github.com/dec0dOS/amazing-github-template)
  for a huge kickstart in welcoming and accessible documentation.

- [sheerun/modern-node](https://github.com/sheerun/modern-node) for linting and
  formatting magic, using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/),
  [eslint](https://eslint.org/), [standardJS](https://standardjs.com/) and
  [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

- [facebook/docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) for this very
  documentation site you're reading.

- [jonathandion/awesome-emails](https://github.com/jonathandion/awesome-emails)
  for introducing us to MJML in the first place!
