Thank you for taking the time to contribute!

Premail is open-source, and contributions are what make the open-source
community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions
you make will benefit everybody else and are **greatly appreciated**!

When contributing, especially for the first time, consider starting by
[creating an issue](https://github.com/premail/premail/issues/new) so you can
get feedback from the maintainers and avoid unncessary work.

**Note:** Premail has a [code of conduct](https://premail.dev/code_of_conduct/).
Please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Issues and feature requests

You've found a bug in the source code, a mistake in the documentation or maybe
you'd like a new feature? You can help us by
[submitting an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/premail/premail/issues).
Before you create an issue, make sure to search the issue archive -- your issue
may have already been addressed!

Please try to create bug reports that are:

- _Reproducible._ Include steps to reproduce the problem.
- _Specific._ Include as much detail as possible: which version, what
  environment, etc.
- _Unique._ Do not duplicate existing opened issues.
- _Scoped to a single bug._ One bug per report.

**Even better: Submit a pull request with a fix or new feature!**
