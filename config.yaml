# QUICKSTART CONFIGURATION
#
# This file is formatted in YAML -- indentation and whitespace is important!
#
# If you're not familiar with YAML, there are lots of guides and many
# implementations out there. Here are some examples:
# https://blog.stackpath.com/yaml/
# https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1214409/Learn-YAML-in-five-minutes
# https://yaml.org
#
# tl;dr: You can edit things on the right side of colons (:) but not on the
# left. Don't change the indentation or spacing.
#
# For design configuration, see themeConfig.yaml inside individual design
# directories.
#

# 1. Folders
folders:
  design:
    # Name of the folder for designs
    name: designs

    # If no design is specified, default to this directory
    default: _templates

  theme:
    # Subdirectory of designs in which settings for styling are kept
    dir: theme

  email:
    # Name of the folder for individual emails
    name: emails

  output:
    # Subdirectory of emails in which to export HTML code
    dir: dist

# 2. Files and file types
files:
  # Name of the main template file
  template: index.tpl

# @TODO: This should really go in an email-specific config file.
# 3. Email-building options
text:
  # Whether or not to generate a plain-text version. The subsequent options only
  # apply if this is set to "true". Note that while only a small portion of
  # recipients will see the text version, it appears to lower the risk of your
  # email being interpreted as spam. Resources:

  # https://www.indiehackers.com/post/10-tips-for-better-email-deliverability-0f73b1fbee
  generate: true

  # When set to true, images are replaced by URLs to the image file in the
  # plaintext version. Set to false to omit these images completely. Any tags
  # wrapping the images (such as link tags) will be unaffected.
  images: false

  # Whether to include the following elements in the plain-text version.
  include:
    topNav: true
    banner: true
    salutation: true
    signoff: true
    social: true
    bottomNav: true
    footer: true

# 3. Language
language:
  # Sets the default language wrapping each email. This must be set to a valid
  # lanugage tag to inform assistive devices like screen readers. If you have
  # multilingual emails, you can include `lang` attributes in wrapping <div>
  # tags. Resources:
  # https://github.com/hteumeuleu/email-guidelines#lang
  # https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry
  default: en

# 4. Nitpicky Options
nitpick:
  # previewPad: When set to true, appends spaces to the preview or preheader
  # text you enter to ensure that the rest of the content of your email isn't
  # pulled up into the preview. Resources:
  # https://www.goodemailcode.com/email-code/preheader
  previewPad: true
