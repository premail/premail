/* PSEUDO-CLASS STYLES
 *
 * WARNING: Pseudo-classes in CSS are for states like "hover", "active" and
 * "focus". Only a some email recipients will see these. Consequently, you
 * should only use these styles for progressive enhancement; ensure usability
 * and readability even when these styles are not applied.
 *
 * Resources:

 * https://www.emailonacid.com/blog/article/email-development/using-pseudo-elements-to-progressively-enhance-your-emails/
 *
 * In order to override the inlined styles, all styles below need to include the
 * !important flag, so be sure to test in all contexts (e.g. if you change a
 * link's color on hover, make sure it still works in the context of buttons,
 * navigation menus, the footer, headings/subheadings, social icons, etc.).
