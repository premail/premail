# PREMAIL CONFIGURATION
#
# This file is formatted in YAML -- indentation and whitespace is important!
#
# If you're not familiar with YAML, there are lots of guides and many
# implementations out there. Here are some examples:
# https://blog.stackpath.com/yaml/
# https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1214409/Learn-YAML-in-five-minutes
# https://yaml.org
#
# tl;dr: You can edit things on the right side of colons (:) but not on the
# left. Don't change the indentation or spacing.
#
# For email configuration, see the `emailConfig.yaml` file located in each
# individual email directory.
#
# For design configuration, see the `designConfig.yaml` file located in each
# design's directory.
#

# Set default directories for this project. These can be overridden in design
# and email settings.
dirs:
  design:
    # Name of the parent directory containing each individual design
    name: designs

    # If no design is specified when building, default to this design
    default: _default

  theme:
    # Subdirectory of each design where styles are kept
    dir: theme

  email:
    # Name of the parent directory containing each individual email
    name: emails

  output:
    # When building a project, save files to this subdirectory of the design
    # or email
    dir: dist
