{{!-- A banner image, also known as a "hero image". For Retina display, the
width and height set below should each be half the actual size of the image in
pixels. Note that if you choose to use text over your image, it's a good idea to
have a background-color on the text as well, because of Gmail's dark-mode color
inversion. For details, see the "Color values" section of designConfig.yaml.
