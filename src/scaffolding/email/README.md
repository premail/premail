# Email: Blank email

This directory contains the stub files for a new email. You can replace this
file with information about your own email if you wish.

Settings for this email are defined in `emailConfig.yaml`.

Because this example email does not define a design in these settings, it uses
the default design, as defined in your project's `premail.yaml` file.

Designs can also be defined on the command line using the `-d` flag, in which
case they override any file-based settings.

For more information about Premail's file structure, take a look at the
`_example` email included with Premail, or see
https://premail.dev/docs/overview/usage/explore-design-structure

Any file in an email will override the same file in the design.
