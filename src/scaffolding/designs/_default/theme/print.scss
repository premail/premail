/* PRINT STYLES
 *
 * These are styles that only get applied when a recipient prints the email
 * from their email client.
 *
 * Below we set print styles in the most conservative way possible -- just
 * making sure things don't break. However, you might want to add to them to do
 * things like use serif rather than sans-serif fonts (better for print),
 * adjusting the font size, or hiding elements (such as navigation).
 *
 * Email clients, of course, vary in how well they implement these, and some
 * might set their own print styles on top of what is defined in the email
 * itself. Outlook is the only major platform that currently has no support.
 * For an updated list of clients and their support for the @media rule (which
 * is what we use for print stylesheets) see:
 * https://caniuse.email/#css-media-queries
 * https://www.caniemail.com/features/css-at-media/
 *
 * Many people do still print out emails, especially for things like invitations
 * or coupons, although this depends to some extent on your audience
 * demographic. There are surprisingly few guides on working with this; the only
 * comprehensive one is the following archived version of a (since removed)
 * blog from Campaign Monitor:
 *

 *
 * In order to override the inlined styles, all styles below need to include the
 * !important flag, so be sure to test!

   * Printing Data Tables
   *
   * You are unlikely to be including actual data tables (tabular data) in your
   * email because these don't display well at narrow screen widths. But if you
   * do find yourself doing this, you can improve the printing of them by using
   * the following rules. Make sure to target the data tables only (and not all
   * the tables necessary for positioning elements in the email) with a class.
   *
   * table.data-table { display: table; width: 100%; max-width: 100%; }
   * .data-table thead { display: table-header-group; }
   * .data-table tr { display: table-row; page-break-inside: avoid; }
   * .data-table td { display: table-cell; }
